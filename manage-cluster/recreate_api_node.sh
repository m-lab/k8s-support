# Recreates an existing, healthy API node in an existing k8s cluster. This
# script assumes that there are functional nodes in the API cluster for both of
# the other zones not being recreated.
#
# The use case for this script is when there is a need to recreate an existing,
# healthy API node e.g., an upgrade to the base OS image. This script will allow
# an operator to recreate the API cluster one node at a time, with no downtime
# for the cluster.
