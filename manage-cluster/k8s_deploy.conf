# TODO (kinkade): In its current form, the service account associated with
# the GCE instances need full access to a single GCS storage bucket for the
# purposes of moving around k8s TLS files, etc. Without special configuration of
# the bucket and service account, for this to work, the service account needs
# the "storage-full" scope, which is far more permissive than we ultimately
# want. Additionally, it was discovered that the cluster would not initialize
# properly with some scopes defined, but other ones missing. As of this writing
# it is unclear which scopes are needed for the "gce" k8s cloud provider plugin
# to work as intended. To get around this for testing, we are just giving the
# "cloud-platform" scope, which is pretty much full access (and includes the
# needed "storage-full" scope). The permissions should likely be dialed back as
# we learn more.

# Whether the script should exit after deleting all existing GCP resources

# manually hunt down all the old objects all over the GCP console. For
# example, many objects names are based on the variable $GCE_BASE_NAME. If you
# were to assign another value to that variable and run this script, any old,
# existing objects will not be removed, and will linger orphaned in the GCP
# project. One way to use this would be to set the following to "yes", run this
# script, _then_ change any base object names, reset this to "no" and run this
# script.
